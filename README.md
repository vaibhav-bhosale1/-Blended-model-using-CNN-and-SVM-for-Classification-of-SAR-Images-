# -Blended-model-using-CNN-and-SVM-for-Classification-of-SAR-Images-
Developed a hybrid CNN-SVM model for classifying SAR images of military vehicles (e.g., 2S1, BRDM_2, BTR60). Used CNN for feature extraction and SVM for accurate classification. Enhanced Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) in SAR imagery with improved precision and scalability.
