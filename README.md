## Data Preprocessing

- **Rescaling:** Pixel values normalized to the `[0,1]` range.  
- **Shear Range:** Random shear within `0.2` for perspective variation.  
- **Rotation Range:** Random rotations within `10Â°`.  
- **Zoom Range:** Zoom in/out for focusing on specific details.  
- **Horizontal Flip:** Random flips for increased orientation variations.

- ## Model Architecture

1. **Hybrid CNN-SVM Model**: Features are extracted from SAR images using a deep **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, followed by classification with a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** enhanced by a squared hinge loss function with L2 regularization.

2. **Input Preprocessing**: SAR images are resized to **128x128 grayscale** format, normalized to the `[0, 1]` range, and processed through a rescaling layer for numerical stability.

3. **Feature Extraction**: The CNN model includes **three convolutional layers** (32 kernels, 3x3) with **ReLU activation** and **max-pooling layers** to capture spatial details while reducing dimensionality.

4. **Fully Connected Layer**: Features are flattened and passed to a dense layer with **128 neurons (ReLU activation)** for refinement before classification. The final layer uses **softmax activation** for multi-class classification with L2 regularization to minimize overfitting.

5. **Benchmarking Models**: The hybrid model is compared against **CNN, VGG19, and ResNet architectures**, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying military vehicles from SAR imagery.

6. **ResNet**: Integrates **residual blocks** with skip connections for efficient training, addressing diminishing gradients while learning complex feature mappings.

7. **VGG19 Adaptation**: Fine-tuned to classify SAR imagery by replacing its fully connected layers with **custom dense layers**, leveraging its hierarchical feature extraction capabilities for improved performance.
